                                        Melissa L. Blakeney is a native of Gadsden, South Carolina. She is a graduate of the public schools of South Carolina. In 1999, Mrs. Blakeney enrolled at College of Charleston, where she completed her Bachelor of Arts in Biology with a minor in
                                        Physical Health. Upon graduating in 2003, Melissa heard God's calling and decided that nursing would be her journey in life.

                                    <p>
                                        She completed her Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina and soon after, completed her Master of Science in Nursing as a Family Nurse Practitioner at the University of South Carolina
                                        in Columbia, South Carolina. Mrs. Blakeney has worked with a number of healthcare providers in South Carolina; in 2010, she relocated to Charlotte and fell in love with the "Queen City."

                                        For the last five years, Melissa has served many of Charlotte's underinsured and uninsured populations. During this time, she noticed that mental health was being overlooked and understaffed. Therefore, Melissa jumped on the pursuit to provide
                                        optimal mental and primary care to the community she loved. Mrs. Blakeney is currently working on her Post Master's Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner certification and will graduate in May 2015. Melissa hopes to help as many people that have helped her
                                        along the way, even if it takes a lifetime.
