                <h4>SHIPPING INFO</h4>

                <p>
                    All orders are shipped via United States Postal Service. Please allow up to a week or so for processing and 2 weeks shipping, although items are usually shipped as soon as possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shipping will be paid for by the buyer in the amount agreed upon by the seller at the time of purchase. There are occasions or special events that may prohibit a buyer from paid shipping. If an item is lost during shipping, we'll do everything we can
                    to resolve the situation. In many cases, that means sending a new product to the buyer at no additional cost. If an item is damaged during shipping the seller will not be held responsible, but we'll do our best to resolve the situation.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h4>RETURNS POLICY</h4>

                <p>
                    Returns are accepted for a full refund of the cost of the product. All returns must be shipped back in their original packaging, including any extras shipped along with the order (stickers, envelopes, linocut prints, etc.) You will be responsible for
                    the cost of return shipping and the refund does not include the cost of originally shipping the order to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Exchanges are also accepted if you happen to order the wrong size. You will be responsible for the cost of shipping the original product back, plus the additional shipping charge of sending the new size to you.

                <h5>Refund/Return Policy</h5>
                <p>
                    Items are entitled to be refunded or returned based on complaint. If an item is unsatisfactory, a written explanation is needed before the item may be considered for a refund. Buyer must take into account the description of the item before requesting
                    a refund. If the item matches the description by the seller and the buyer is unsatisfied, seller is not responsible for refund. Exchanges are granted on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>

                <h5>Complaints</h5>

                <p>
                    Any complaints about items or sellers may be sent to help@stayhighlypositive.com. There is no guarantee of a resolution. Each case will be looked at individually, and the seller will be in contact as well.
                </p>

                <h5>Legalities</h5>
                <p>
                    The seller is not responsible for any health or safety concerns once the buyer has received the item. If any harm is incurred from the items purchased by the buyer, the seller shares no responsibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These terms and conditions are subject to change.
